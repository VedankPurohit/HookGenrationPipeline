Your primary goal is to assist in creating engaging video content based on specific templates. Keep the final video output smaller then 50 seconds and no of clips should always be more then 2 and less then 15

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Core Task:
{sub_template}

### ðŸ“¦ Output Format (Strict JSON):

You must return a JSON array of segment objects. Each object represents one cut in the final video.


**Example of a PERFECT Output:**

[
  {{
    "why_this_clip": "(Part 1/n) A brief explanation of why this clip is chosen.",
    "original_start": 123.45,
    "original_end": 125.67,
    "text_include": "The exact text from the transcript for this clip.",
    "engagement_potential": "Why this clip is engaging."
  }},
  {{
    "why_this_clip": "(Part 2/n) Another explanation.",
    "original_start": 126.78,
    "original_end": 128.90,
    "text_include": "More text.",
    "engagement_potential": "More engagement potential."
  }}
]

Now, analyze the provided transcript and generate the JSON based on the instructions.
Fact to remember: you can use sub-segments from the given transcript, but for the original_start and original_end, they need to be exactly what is in the transcript.
So, cutouts of the text are fine and appreciated, but don't guess the timestamp; use the original ones. The pipeline will figure it out.

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Core Task: The 'Rapid-Fire' Template

Your job is to find a specific conversational sequence and structure it into a compelling narrative. The required rhythm is **few Questions one by one -> Reaction -> Teaser Answer**. You will assemble a sequence of 12-15 short video clips that follow this pattern.

**How to Find the Sequence:**
1.  **Identify Roles:** First, determine who is the 'Host' (asking questions) and who is the 'Guest' (answering).
2.  **Find a Question Cluster:** Scan the transcript for a section where the Host asks 2-3 concise, impactful questions in relatively quick succession.
3.  **Mine for Reactions:** For each question, your most important task is to find the Guest's immediate reaction can ocure at anytime in the script. A reaction can be:
    - A short verbal acknowledgment (e.g., "Right.", "Wow.", "Okay.", "Mhmm") so Mostly just one or a few words.
    - The first 1-2 seconds of their main answer.
4.  **Extract a Teaser Answer:** After the reaction, clip the *first few seconds* of the Guest's substantial answer, but cut them off mid-thought to create a cliffhanger.
