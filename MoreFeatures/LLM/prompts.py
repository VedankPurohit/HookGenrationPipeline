# Multi-short generation wrapper - generates N distinct non-overlapping shorts
multi_short_wrapper = """
### 🎬 MULTI-SHORT GENERATION MODE

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** You must generate **{count} COMPLETELY SEPARATE short videos** from this transcript.

Each short video is a SEPARATE, STANDALONE piece of content. They must:
1. **NOT OVERLAP** - No timestamp ranges can be shared between shorts
2. **COVER DIFFERENT TOPICS** - Each short should highlight a different moment/topic
3. **BE INDEPENDENTLY ENGAGING** - Each short must work on its own

---
### 📦 OUTPUT FORMAT FOR MULTI-SHORT MODE:

Return a JSON object with {count} shorts, each containing its own array of clips:

```json
{{
  "short_1": {{
    "theme": "Brief description of this short's theme",
    "clips": [
      {{
        "why_this_clip": "(Part 1/n) ...",
        "original_start": 100.0,
        "original_end": 105.0,
        "sentence_context": "...",
        "text_include": "...",

      }}
    ]
  }},
  "short_2": {{
    "theme": "Different theme for short 2",
    "clips": [...]
  }}
}}
```

### ⚠️ MULTI-SHORT RULES:
1. **ZERO OVERLAP** - If short_1 uses timestamps 100-150s, short_2 CANNOT use any time in that range
2. **SPREAD ACROSS VIDEO** - Use different sections of the transcript for each short
3. **EACH SHORT = 30-50 seconds** - Each individual short should be 30-50 seconds total
4. **UNIQUE HOOKS** - Each short needs its own compelling hook

4. **Clips should flow together** - the final video must feel cohesive, not random
5. **Hook early** - place the most attention-grabbing content first

### 🔥 RAPID-FIRE Q&A HOOK TEMPLATE

**Goal:** Create a fast-paced, high-energy clip that feels like a rapid-fire interview. Think Joe Rogan's best moments, Hot Ones questions, or viral podcast clips.

---
### THE RHYTHM: Question → Reaction → Teaser (cut mid-sentence)

**Step 1: Find the Gold**
Scan the transcript for:
- Sharp, punchy questions (especially rhetorical or provocative ones)

- Moments of genuine emotion or reaction
- "Wait, what?" moments that make viewers lean in

**Step 2: Build the Sequence (5-12 clips)**
1. **HOOK (Clip 1-2):** Start with the most intriguing question OR a shocking statement
2. **TENSION (Clip 3-5):** Quick reactions, follow-up questions, building energy
3. **PAYOFF TEASE (Final clips):** Cut the speaker off mid-answer to create a cliffhanger

**Step 3: Mine for Reactions**
Look for these goldmines:
- Short acknowledgments: "Wow.", "Exactly.", "That's crazy.", "Right."
- Laughs or verbal reactions
- The FIRST 2-3 words of a substantial answer (then cut!)

---
### ⚠️ RAPID-FIRE RULES:

✅ **DO:**
- Keep clips SHORT (1-4 seconds each is ideal)
- Cut speakers off mid-sentence to create suspense
- Maintain chronological order within each Q&A sequence

# ============================================================================
# HYPERCUT TEMPLATE (Fast-Paced, Heavy Editing, Redactions)
# ============================================================================

HyperCut = """
### ⚡ HYPERCUT - FAST-PACED AGGRESSIVE EDITING

**Goal:** Create a HYPER-EDITED, fast-paced video with aggressive cuts. Think TikTok edits, meme compilations, or viral "best moments" compilations. Maximum energy through editing.

---
## 🎯 HYPERCUT PHILOSOPHY

This is NOT a traditional clip. You are creating a **rapid-fire montage** where:
- Individual clips are 0.5-3 seconds each
- Words are DELIBERATELY CUT from sentences to create impact
- Chronological order is OPTIONAL - go for maximum energy flow
- Silence and "dead air" words are completely eliminated

---
## 🔪 REDACTION TECHNIQUE (CRITICAL!)

**You MUST actively redact words from sentences.** This creates punchy, impactful clips.

### Example of Redaction:
- **Full sentence:** "So basically what I'm trying to say is that the market is completely broken"
- **Redacted for impact:** "the market is completely broken" (cut "So basically what I'm trying to say is that")

### Another Example:
- **Full sentence:** "I think, you know, honestly speaking, this changes everything"  
- **Redacted for impact:** "this changes everything" (cut "I think, you know, honestly speaking,")

### HOW TO SPECIFY REDACTION:
```json
{
  "sentence_context": "So basically what I'm trying to say is that the market is completely broken",
  "text_include": "the market is completely broken"
}
```
The system will automatically CUT the words from sentence_context that are NOT in text_include.

---
## 📋 CLIP SELECTION RULES:

1. **QUANTITY:** Generate 10-20 clips (more is better for this format)
2. **LENGTH:** Each clip should be 0.5-3 seconds (rarely longer)
3. **CONTENT:**
   - Punchy statements
   - Emotional reactions ("Wow", "That's crazy", "No way")
   - Key words only (redact filler words aggressively)
   - Questions (especially rhetorical)
   - Numbers and statistics
   - Names of people/places/things
   
4. **ORDER:** NON-CHRONOLOGICAL is encouraged. Arrange for:
   - Maximum energy flow
   - Building tension
   - Surprise cuts
   - Punchline structures (setup → payoff)

---
## 🎬 CLIP TYPES TO INCLUDE:

| Type | Duration | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Reaction | 0.5-1s | "Wow." "Exactly." "What?" |
| Punchline | 1-2s | "...a billion dollars." |
| Question | 1-3s | "But here's the thing..." |
| Statement | 2-3s | "This changes everything." |
| Number | 1-2s | "Forty years." "One mile." |

---
## ⚠️ HYPERCUT RULES:

✅ **DO:**
- Cut aggressively - remove ALL filler words
- Create sentence fragments that stand alone
- Mix chronological order for energy
- Use reactions as transitions
- Create rhythm through editing

❌ **DON'T:**
- Include full, complete sentences (boring!)
- Keep "um", "uh", "like", "you know"
- Preserve context that doesn't add value
- Make clips longer than 4 seconds
- Keep slow, meandering content

---
## 📦 OUTPUT FORMAT:

Return 10-20 clips. **Total duration: 30-60 seconds** (many short clips = longer total).

For EACH clip:
```json
{
  "why_this_clip": "(Part X/Y) Why this specific fragment hits",
  "original_start": EXACT_START,
  "original_end": EXACT_END,
  "sentence_context": "Full sentence from transcript (8+ words for reliable matching)",
  "text_include": "ONLY the words you want to keep (this is your REDACTION tool!)",
  "engagement_potential": "What makes this fragment punchy"
}
```

**Remember: Every word costs attention. Cut ruthlessly. Make it hit.**

**Step 4:** Arrange for maximum impact (hook first, cliffhanger last)

**Clip Length Guidelines:**
- Hook clips: 1-3 seconds (punchy, attention-grabbing)
- Content clips: 3-8 seconds (deliver value)
- Cliffhanger: 2-4 seconds (cut mid-thought)

---
## ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES

1. **`sentence_context`** = Copy 8-10+ words exactly from transcript (for reliable matching)
2. **`text_include`** = The specific words you want in the clip (can be subset of sentence_context)
3. **`original_start/end`** = Use the EXACT timestamps shown in transcript
4. **Order matters** - Arrange clips for narrative flow, not just chronologically
5. **Quality > Quantity** - 5 great clips beat 12 mediocre ones

---
**You have full creative control. Make something people can't scroll past.**
