This module is a placeholder for a future feature: Dynamic Sound Effect Engine.

**Feature Objective:**
To intelligently add sound effects (e.g., whooshes, clicks, risers) to the
final video to emphasize cuts, highlight on-screen text, or add a layer of
professional polish.

**Rationale:**
Sound design is a critical but often overlooked part of video production.
Subtle sound effects can make edits feel more intentional and can significantly
boost viewer engagement and retention.

**High-Level Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Sound Effect Library:**
    - Curate a library of high-quality, royalty-free sound effects and organize
      them by category (e.g., 'transitions', 'impacts', 'ui_sounds').
    - Store these in a dedicated `assets/sfx` directory.

2.  **Trigger Identification:**
    - Identify key moments in the editing timeline that could be enhanced by a
      sound effect. Examples include:
        - The start of a new clip (transition sound).
        - The moment a filler word is removed (subtle whoosh).
        - When a subtitle appears on screen (gentle pop or click).

3.  **Audio Mixing:**
    - Use FFmpeg's audio filtering and mixing capabilities to overlay the selected
      sound effects onto the main audio track at the precise timestamps.
    - Implement volume controls to ensure the sound effects enhance, rather than
      distract from, the primary audio.

4.  **Configuration:**
    - Add settings to `config.py` to enable/disable the feature, control the
      overall volume of the sound effects, and select different "packs" of sounds
      (e.g., 'corporate', 'energetic').

**Current Status:**
This feature is in the planning stage. No code has been implemented yet.
