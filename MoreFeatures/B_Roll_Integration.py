This module is a placeholder for a future feature: Automatic B-Roll Integration.

**Feature Objective:**
To automatically search for and insert relevant B-roll or stock footage based on
the content of the transcript. This would dramatically increase the visual appeal
and production quality of the generated hooks.

**Rationale:**
B-roll is essential for creating dynamic and engaging videos. It helps to break
up monotonous "talking head" shots and provides visual context for the topics
being discussed. Automating this process would be a significant value-add.

**High-Level Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Keyword Extraction:**
    - Analyze the transcript for each clip to extract key nouns, verbs, and concepts
      (e.g., "machine learning," "new product," "data analysis").

2.  **Stock Footage API Integration:**
    - Integrate with a stock footage provider that has a robust API (e.g., Pexels,
      Pixabay, or a paid service like Shutterstock).
    - Use the extracted keywords to perform searches against the API.

3.  **Intelligent Selection:**
    - Develop a scoring system to select the best B-roll clip based on relevance,
      length, and visual style.
    - Ensure the selected clip's duration is appropriate for the segment it will cover.

4.  **Video Insertion:**
    - Modify the FFmpeg pipeline in `EditingEffects.py` to overlay the downloaded
      B-roll footage at the appropriate timestamps, potentially keeping the original
      audio track running underneath.

5.  **Configuration:**
    - Add settings to `config.py` to enable/disable this feature, provide API keys,
      and control B-roll behavior (e.g., how often it should appear).

**Current Status:**
This feature is in the planning stage. No code has been implemented yet.
